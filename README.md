## About the Project

The **Memory Card Game** is a fun and interactive game where the player needs to match pairs of identical cards. 

### What You Need to Do

1. **Implement the Game Logic**:
   - The game will display a set of cards face down.
   - Players click to flip the cards and match pairs.
   - If two cards match, they stay face-up; if not, they flip back.
   - Track the number of moves and time taken to complete the game.

2. **Enhance the User Interface**:
   - Use the `style.css` file to style the cards and the game board.
   - Ensure that the game looks polished and intuitive.

3. **Test the Game**:
   - Make sure the game functions correctly by testing the card flipping, matching logic, and user interactions.

## How to Participate

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To start, clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-card-game.git
   ```

2. **Develop the Game**:
   Modify the `script.js` file to implement the game logic.
   - The game should randomly shuffle and display the cards.
   - Implement the logic to flip cards, check for matches, and track the number of moves and time taken.

3. **Push Your Changes**:
   Once you've completed your solution, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

4. **Submit Your Solution**:
